RubyText
--------

RubyText is a curses wrapper that is in the early experimental
stages. The code has bugs. Running it may cause general bad luck
as well as demon infestation.

Install the `rubytext` gem and then run the demo or the slides
or both.

```
  $ gem install rubytext
  $ rubytext demo      # 2-minute demo
  $ rubytext slides    # longer "slideshow"
```

There is also `examples/ide.rb` ("world's simplest Ruby IDE").
It is _very_ dumb.  :)
