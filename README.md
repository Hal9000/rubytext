RubyText
--------

RubyText is a curses wrapper that is in the early experimental
stages. The code has bugs. Running it may cause general bad luck
as well as demon infestation.

For now, just run the `examples/demo.rb` program.

There is also `examples/ide.rb` ("world's simplest Ruby IDE").
It is _very_ dumb.  :)

*More later...*
