cbreak routine disables line buffering and erase/kill character-processing 
(interrupt and flow control characters are unaffected), making characters 
typed by the user immediately available to the program. 

nocbreak returns the terminal to normal (cooked) mode.

A program should call cbreak or nocbreak explicitly. 
Most interactive programs using curses set the cbreak mode. 
Note that cbreak overrides raw.

The echo and noecho routines control whether characters are echoed by getch
Echoing by the tty driver is always disabled, but initially getch is in echo mode.
most interactive programs disable echoing 

keypad option enables keypad of user's terminal. 
User can press a function key (e.g. arrow) and getch returns a single 
value e.g. KEY_LEFT. 

Skip for now: 
halfdelay 
intrflush option 

Skip?
nodelay causes getch to be a non-blocking call. 
If no input is ready, getch returns ERR.

Skip?
notimeout(win, TRUE) -- wgetch does not set a timer. 
Differentiate between sequences received from a function key and those typed by a user.

raw and noraw -- 
Raw mode is similar to cbreak mode -- characters typed are immediately passed through.
Differences: in raw mode -- the interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow control characters 
are all passed through uninterpreted, instead of generating a signal. The behavior of 
the BREAK key depends on other bits in the tty driver that are not set by curses.

timeout and wtimeout routines set blocking or non-blocking read for a given window.
